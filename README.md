# TurqTodo
TurqTodo is an app that will help the user keep track of different todo lists.
It has been made with left handed people in mind.
Some layout decisions were made to better suit a left-handed person. The button for adding new lists and tasks is in the lower left corner, since that is the hand they are holding their phone with.
The button for deleting lists and tasks is still on the right, since it should be further away so as to not accidentally delete something.
More color themes were planned, but implementation of core features took priority.
